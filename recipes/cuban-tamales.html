    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Cuban tamales, known as "Tamales Cubanos," are a traditional dish in Cuban
      cuisine. These tamales differ from those found in other Latin American
      countries in terms of preparation and ingredients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuban tamales are typically made with a masa (dough) primarily composed of
      cornmeal. The masa is seasoned with a mixture of ingredients such as pork
      lard, garlic, cumin, and sometimes annatto for color. The filling often
      includes a seasoned mixture of pork, ham, or other meats, as well as
      ingredients like olives, raisins, and capers for additional flavor
      complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process of making Cuban tamales is a labor-intensive and communal
      effort, often prepared for special occasions or holidays. The masa is
      spread onto banana leaves, which serve as a natural wrapper for the
      tamales. The filling is placed in the center of the masa, and the banana
      leaves are folded over to encase the tamale securely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuban tamales are typically steamed rather than boiled. They are arranged
      in layers inside a large pot or steamer, with additional banana leaves
      used to separate the layers. The tamales are then steamed until the masa
      is cooked and has a firm, slightly sponge-like texture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once cooked, Cuban tamales are unwrapped from the banana leaves before
      serving. They are often served with a side of salsa or a garlic-based
      sauce known as "mojo" to enhance the flavors. Cuban tamales are a beloved
      part of the country's culinary heritage, reflecting the influence of
      Spanish, African, and indigenous Taino cultures. They are enjoyed not only
      as a delicious dish but also as a symbol of family and community
      gatherings.

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in large saucepan or Dutch oven over
        medium-high heat. Cook and stir pork in hot oil until lightly browned, 5
        to 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 1/2 cup white wine into saucepan and bring to a boil while scraping
        the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden
        spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir 2 cups water, 5 cloves garlic, 1 tablespoon tomato paste, 1 beef
        bouillon cube, bay leaves, cumin, oregano, and black pepper to pork
        mixture. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, partially cover
        the saucepan with a lid, and simmer until pork is very tender, 1 to 2
        hours. Transfer pork to a bowl and reserve cooking liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining olive oil in a deep pot over medium-high heat. Cook and
        stir chorizo and cooked pork in hot oil until lightly browned, 3 to 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir onion, green pepper, and remaining minced garlic into chorizo
        mixture; saute until vegetables soften and onion is translucent, about 5
        minutes. Add remaining white wine, olives, 1 tablespoon tomato paste,
        and remaining bouillon cube; cook, stirring frequently, until flavors
        combine, about 5 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pulse corn and 1 1/2 cups reserved pork broth together in a blender or
        food processor until mixture has a thick and chunky consistency. Stir
        corn mixture into pork-chorizo mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium and stir masa harina, sugar, vinegar, and salt
        into pork mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture has a
        hearty cornmeal porridge-consistency. Season with salt and remove from
        heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a pocket out of one corn husk and fill 3/4 full with pork mixture,
        leaving a top flap. Wrap another husk around the filled pocket. Fold top
        flap over the pocket. Tie twine length- and width-wise around the tamale
        several times so that packet is secure, but has room for filling to
        expand during cooking. Repeat with remaining husks and filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill a pot with 2-inches of water; bring to a simmer. Place tamales
        upright in simmering water, cover the pot, and cook, adding water as
        necessary, until filling is hot and set, about 40 minutes. Cool tamales
        until completely set, at least 3 hours.
