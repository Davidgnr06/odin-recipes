    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Arroz Imperial is a classic Cuban dish that translates to "Imperial Rice"
      in English. This flavorful and indulgent dish is known for its unique
      combination of ingredients and its popularity in Cuban cuisine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main components of Arroz Imperial include rice, chicken, mayonnaise,
      and cheese. The rice is typically seasoned with spices such as cumin and
      saffron, giving it a rich and aromatic flavor. The chicken is often cooked
      and shredded, becoming a key protein component. Mayonnaise is used to
      create a creamy layer, and cheese, often a mild, meltable variety, is
      layered on top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arroz Imperial is assembled in layers. First, a base layer of seasoned
      rice is spread in a baking dish. On top of the rice, a layer of shredded
      and seasoned chicken is added. The dish is then covered with a creamy
      mixture of mayonnaise, creating a smooth and rich texture. The final touch
      is the layer of cheese, which melts during the baking process, creating a
      golden and bubbly crust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assembled dish is baked until the cheese is melted and golden brown,
      and the flavors meld together. This creates a delicious and comforting
      casserole with a satisfying combination of textures and tastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arroz Imperial is often served in squares or wedges, similar to a
      casserole. It can be garnished with additional spices, herbs, or a drizzle
      of sauce for added flavor and visual appeal. Arroz Imperial is a
      celebratory dish enjoyed during special occasions and gatherings. Its
      decadent combination of ingredients makes it a flavorful representation of
      Cuban culinary traditions, and it holds a special place in the hearts of
      those who appreciate the richness of Cuban comfort food.

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove the skin from the chicken and boil it in a pressure cooker with 1 onion, 2 cloves of garlic, bay leaf, cumin, a tablespoon of tomato puree, salt and the chicken stock cube. As the time varies depending on the pot used, it should be boiled until very soft.</li>
      <li>Simultaneously, chop the ham into very small pieces, sauté it in the pan with a well-macerated clove of garlic, and leave it in a container, draining the oil that you used.</li>
      <li>Boil the shrimp and when you take them out without breaking them up, mix them with finely chopped onion, white pepper and sauté them in the pan, then leave them in a container.</li>
      <li>When the chicken is soft, remove it from the broth and shred it, and in the pan with a little oil, cook it with finely chopped onion, a clove of garlic, paprika, and a tablespoon of tomato puree.</li>
      <li>Prepare in a pot, a little oil, chopped onion, striped or chopped bell peppers, cumin (1/2 teaspoon), rice coloring (saffron or bijol) to taste and add the rice to this sauce.</li>
      <li>Cook the rice until the color evens out over medium heat, and add 2 cups of wine or beer, and 1 1/2 of the chicken broth that was left when you took it out. Add salt to taste and cook as usual. If you cook it in a pressure cooker: put the lid on and when the pressure comes on, put it on low heat for 20 minutes. In a normal pot, put it over high heat and when it comes to a boil, cover it and leave it on low heat for 20 minutes.</li>
        <p class="duff">Once the rice is cooked, take a refractory mold and proceed as follows:</p>
        <p>
           
        <ol>
          <li>Pour rice on the bottom up to about 2 cm., and tamp it with a slotted spoon, cover with mayonnaise, spreading it over the surface of the rice, add part of the shrimp (or all).</li>
          <li>Cover with rice again 2 cm., proceed in the same way, tamp and add mayonnaise, add a layer of chicken.</li>
          <li>Cover with rice again 2 cm., proceed in the same way, tamp and add mayonnaise, add a layer of ham.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <li>And continue until you finish with a layer of rice, alternating ham, chicken and shrimp per layer. The chicken should always be the predominant one, that is, there should be more layers of chicken than ham or shrimp, even one of these two can be interspersed with chicken.</li>
        <li>Once finished, and well compacted, everything can be covered with mayonnaise or not, but in any case, grated cheese is put on top so that it covers the rice as much as possible and it is briefly melted in the oven.</li >
        <li>It can be garnished with peppers, or even with boiled eggs.</li>
    </ol>
